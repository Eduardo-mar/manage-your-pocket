# manage-your-pocket

This is an application I am developing. The idea is that you can keep a clearer record of your expenses, while showing things like; 
where you buy x cheaper product, how much you have left to reach the proposed savings goal, etc..

It is in a start-up phase and therefore there is little done. To see my progress you can look at the develop branch.
